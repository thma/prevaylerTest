# prevaylerTest
playing around with the baisc ideas of the legendary http://prevayler.org/ project.

Many moons ago I wrote a prevayler backend to the Apache OJB O/R mapping tool.  

Recently I became interested in event sourcing an remembered the cool concepts of prevayler.
In this project I took the Interfaces of Prevayler, stripped them down to the bare basics (i.e. the snapshot cpabilities), and wrote a very rudimentary implementation.
