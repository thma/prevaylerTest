# prevaylerTest
playing around with the basic ideas of the legendary http://prevayler.org/ project.

Many moons ago I wrote a prevayler backend to the Apache OJB O/R mapping tool.  

Recently I became interested in event sourcing, log processing, etc. and remembered the cool concepts of prevayler.
In this project I took the Interfaces of Prevayler, stripped them down to the bare basics (i.e. no snapshot capabilities), and wrote a very rudimentary implementation.
